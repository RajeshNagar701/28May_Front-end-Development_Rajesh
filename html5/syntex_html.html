HTML5 is the latest and most enhanced version of HTML. Technically, 
HTML is not a pogramming language, but rather a markup language.
HTML5 is the next major revision of the HTML standard superseding 
HTML 4.01, XHTML 1.0, and XHTML 1.1. HTML5 is a standard for structuring and presenting content on the 
World Wide Web.


HTML 5 does not have the same syntax rules as XHTML where we needed 
lower case tag names, quoting our attributes an attribute had to 
have a value and to close all empty elements.

But HTML5 is coming with lots of flexibility :

Uppercase tag names.  <b>  <B>
Quotes   type="text/css" <img src=""> /  <img src=''>  type='text/css'
Attribute values are optional.   type="text/css"  === if not added that optional
Closing empty elements are optional.   <b></b> /  <b>




The <!DOCTYPE> declaration for HTML5 is very simple:

HTML 5 authors can use simple syntax to specify Character Encoding as follows: 
<meta charset="UTF-8">


<!DOCTYPE>  starting point
<html>
	<head></head>
	<body></head>
</html>





<head>
<meta charset="utf-8" />
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
</head>



New HTML5 Elements
The most interesting new HTML5 elements are: 

New semantic/ structur elements like <header>, <footer>, <article>, and <section>.

New attributes of form elements like number, date, time, calendar, and range.

New graphic elements: <svg> and <canvas>.

New multimedia elements: <audio> and <video>
